  Lab 1: Data Types Practice — Using String Interpolation
  Your Name – Date
  Instructions:
  Follow each step carefully.
  Use string interpolation (backticks `` ` `` and ${ }) for every console message.
  Each console.log() should say:
  "The value stored in the variable [variableName] is [value] and its data type is [type]."
*/

// 1️⃣ String
// Declare a variable named studentName and store your name as a string.
// Use string interpolation to log the sentence describing its value and type.
let studentName="Zahra"
`${studentName} is a string.`
// 2️⃣ Number
// Declare a variable named studentAge and store your age as a number.
// Use string interpolation to log the sentence describing its value and type.
let studentAge=16
 console.log(`${studentAge} is a Number`)
// 3️⃣ Boolean
// Declare a variable named isEnrolled and assign it either true or false.
// Use string interpolation to log the sentence describing its value and type.
let isEnrolled= true
 console.log(`${isEnrolled} is a boolean`)
// 4️⃣ Undefined
// Declare a variable named favoriteSubject but do not assign it a value.
// Use string interpolation to log the sentence describing its value and type.
let favoriteSubject= 
 console.log(`${favoriteSubject} is undefined`)
// 5️⃣ Null
// Declare a variable named nextClass and set it equal to null.
// Use string interpolation to log the sentence describing its value and type.
let nextClass= null
 console.log(`${nextClass} is a null`)
// 6️⃣ Check
// When finished, run your file to verify that all outputs print correctly.
// Run your file by typing node index.js in the terminal

// 6️⃣ Commit & Push
// Save your work and push it for grading
